<h1>Data Visualization with R
<h2>MODULE 1: Capstone Overview and Data Collection</h2>
I gathered and prepared bike-sharing and weather data from multiple sources to analyze and predict bike demand in urban areas. This involved web-scraping a Wikipedia page to extract global bike-sharing system data, retrieving real-time weather conditions and a 5-day forecast using the OpenWeather API, and downloading additional datasets from cloud storage. I structured the collected data into CSV format, including records of active bike-sharing systems worldwide, weather forecasts for multiple cities, geographic data of major cities, and detailed Seoul bike-sharing data with hourly rental records and weather conditions. This comprehensive dataset provided the foundation for further analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
 
<h2>MODULE 2: Data Wrangling</h2>
I performed data wrangling to clean and prepare the bike-sharing datasets for further analysis, ensuring accuracy and consistency. This process involved standardizing column names, removing unnecessary reference links, and extracting numeric values using regular expressions. Additionally, I handled missing values, created dummy variables for categorical data, and normalized the dataset using the dplyr package. These steps improved data quality and structure, making it more suitable for exploratory analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

<h2>MODULE 3: Performing Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL, Tidyverse & ggplot</h2>
I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL and data visualization techniques. I created and loaded database tables, then executed SQL queries with RODBC to extract key insights, such as total bike-sharing records, operational hours, seasonal trends, and city-specific patterns. Additionally, I leveraged the tidyverse and ggplot2 packages to analyze and visualize tabular datasets, using histograms to examine data distributions, scatterplots to identify correlations, and box plots to detect outliers. These techniques allowed me to uncover meaningful patterns and trends, providing valuable insights for further analysis.

<h2>MODULE 4: Predictive Analysis</h2>
I built and refined predictive models to estimate hourly bike-sharing demand using regression techniques. I started by splitting the data into training and testing sets and developed baseline linear regression models—one using only weather variables and another incorporating both weather and date/time features. I then evaluated these models to identify the most influential variables. To enhance prediction accuracy, I refined the models by introducing higher-order terms, interaction terms, and regularization techniques. Through experimentation, I identified the best-performing model, optimizing it for more accurate bike rental demand forecasting.
 
<h2>MODULE 5: Building a R Shiny Dashboard App</h2>
I integrated the regression model into an interactive R-Shiny dashboard, enabling users to explore weather forecasts, predicted bike-sharing demand, and other key insights. I developed a Leaflet-based interactive map to highlight cities with high or low bike demand over the next five days, using color-coded and size-scaled markers to represent demand levels. To enhance user experience, I incorporated a drop-down feature allowing users to drill down into specific cities for detailed analysis. Using ggplot, I visualized trends such as temperature, humidity, and bike-sharing demand through interactive line charts and scatterplots. These features provide an intuitive way to analyze and plan bike distribution based on forecasted demand.

<h2>MODULE 6: Data Presentation</h2>
As the final step in my project, I developed a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation to effectively communicate the insights and findings from my capstone project. The presentation highlighted key aspects of the project, including data collection, wrangling, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and the final results. I structured the slides to ensure clarity, using visual elements such as charts, graphs, and tables to support my analysis. Additionally, I shared my presentation with peers for review and feedback, allowing for constructive discussions on the project’s strengths and areas for improvement. As part of the process, I also evaluated my peers' predictive modeling projects using a structured rubric, enhancing my ability to assess model performance and presentation effectiveness.
